"Your doctor will ask about any factors that can increase the chance of developing thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP).  Typical questions include:

* **Do you have any underlying diseases or conditions?**  
  – Cancer  
  – HIV infection  
  – Lupus (systemic lupus erythematosus)  
  – Other infections  
  – Are you currently pregnant?

* **Have you undergone any major medical procedures?**  
  – For example, a blood‑and‑marrow stem‑cell transplant.

* **What medicines are you taking?**  
  – Prescription drugs such as ticlopidine, clopidogrel, cyclosporine A, hormone therapy, estrogen preparations, or chemotherapy agents.  
  – Over‑the‑counter or herbal products that might contain quinine (found in tonic water and some health supplements).

These questions help your physician evaluate your risk for TTP based on the information provided in the medical‑history section for the condition.","Your doctor will diagnosis thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) based on your medical history, a physical exam, and test results. If TTP is suspected or diagnosed, a hematologist will be involved in your care. A hematologist is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating blood disorders. Medical History Your doctor will ask about factors that may affect TTP. For example, he or she may ask whether you: Have certain diseases or conditions, such as cancer, HIV, lupus, or infections (or whether you're pregnant). Have had previous medical procedures, such as a blood and marrow stem cell transplant. Take certain medicines, such as ticlopidine, clopidogrel, cyclosporine A, or hormone therapy and estrogens, or whether you've had chemotherapy. Have used any products that contain quinine. Quinine is a substance often found in tonic water and nutritional health products. Physical Exam As part of the medical history and physical exam, your doctor will ask about any signs or symptoms you've had. He or she will look for signs such as: Bruising and bleeding under your skin Fever Paleness or jaundice (a yellowish color of the skin or whites of the eyes) A fast heart rate Speech changes or changes in awareness that can range from confusion to passing out Changes in urine Diagnostic Tests Your doctor also may recommend tests to help find out whether you have TTP. Complete Blood Count This test measures the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in your blood. For this test, a sample of blood is drawn from a vein, usually in your arm. If you have TTP, you'll have a lower than normal number of platelets and red blood cells (anemia). Blood Smear For this test, a sample of blood is drawn from a vein, usually in your arm. Some of your blood is put on a glass slide. A microscope is then used to look at your red blood cells. In TTP, the red blood cells are torn and broken. Platelet Count This test counts the number of platelets in a blood smear. People who have TTP have a lower than normal number of platelets in their blood. This test is used with the blood smear to help diagnose TTP. Bilirubin Test When red blood cells die, they release a protein called hemoglobin (HEE-muh-glow-bin) into the bloodstream. The body breaks down hemoglobin into a compound called bilirubin. High levels of bilirubin in the bloodstream cause jaundice. For this blood test, a sample of blood is drawn from a vein, usually in your arm. The level of bilirubin in the sample is checked. If you have TTP, your bilirubin level may be high because your body is breaking down red blood cells faster than normal. Kidney Function Tests and Urine Tests These tests show whether your kidneys are working well. If you have TTP, your urine may contain protein or blood cells. Also, your blood creatinine (kre-AT-ih-neen) level may be high. Creatinine is a blood product that's normally removed by the kidneys. Coombs Test This blood test is used to find out whether TTP is the cause of hemolytic anemia. For this test, a sample of blood is drawn from a vein, usually in your arm. In TTP, hemolytic anemia occurs because red blood cells are broken into pieces as they try to squeeze around blood clots. When TTP is the cause of hemolytic anemia, the Coombs test is negative. The test is positive if antibodies (proteins) are destroying your red blood cells. Lactate Dehydrogenase Test This blood test measures a protein called lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). For this test, a sample of blood is drawn from a vein, usually in your arm. Hemolytic anemia causes red blood cells to break down and release LDH into the blood. LDH also is released from tissues that are injured by blood clots as a result of TTP. ADAMTS13 Assay A lack of activity in the ADAMTS13 enzyme causes TTP. For this test, a sample of blood is drawn from a vein, usually in your arm. The blood is sent to a special lab to test for the enzyme's activity.",53a314dd,What medical history questions will my doctor ask to assess my risk for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura?,exams and tests,0.6549716
"Yes. According to the provided information, the excessive loss of calcium in the urine (hyper‑calciuria) seen in Bartter syndrome can lead to calcium deposition in the kidneys, producing **nephrocalcinosis**. The same calcium loss can also weaken the bones, resulting in **osteopenia** (a bone‑density problem).","What are the signs and symptoms of Bartter syndrome? The signs and symptoms associated with Bartter syndrome can vary depending on the form of Bartter syndrome an affected individual has. The antenatal forms (beginning before birth) can be life-threatening, while the classical form, beginning in early childhood, tends to be less severe. The antenatal forms of Bartter syndrome (types I, II and IV) may first be characterized by abnormally high levels of amniotic fluid surrounding the affected fetus (polyhydramnios); premature delivery; and possibly life-threatening salt (sodium-chloride) loss. Affected newborns may have fever, vomiting, diarrhea, failure to thrive, delayed growth, intellectual disability, and/or distinctive facial features (triangular face, prominent forehead, large eyes, protruding ears, and drooping mouth). Individuals with type IV may also have sensorineural deafness (hearing loss caused by abnormalities in the inner ear). Classical Bartter syndrome typically becomes apparent in infancy and is characterized by failure to thrive and constipation in the first year of life. Symptoms may include salt craving, fatigue, muscle weakness, growth delay and developmental delay. Loss of excess sodium chloride through the urine can lead to dehydration, constipation, and increased urine production (polyuria). Loss of excess calcium through the urine (hypercalciuria) can cause weakening of the bones (osteopenia). When this excess calcium becomes deposited in the kidneys, tissue in the kidneys can become hardened (nephrocalcinosis). Low levels of potassium in the blood (hypokalemia) cause the muscle weakness, cramping, and fatigue in affected individuals. The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Bartter syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition.

"Yes. While surgical excision is the most common first‑line treatment for hemangioendothelioma, radiation therapy (RT) has also been used as a primary, definitive treatment in cases where surgery would compromise function or cosmetic outcome. A 2012 study (Scott et al.) found that definitive RT resulted in no local recurrences and minimal toxicity, suggesting that RT can be an acceptable alternative to surgery when needed.","How might hemangioendothelioma be treated? Treatment for hemangioendothelioma may depend on the type of hemangioendothelioma present in the affected individual and the risk of recurrence or metastases. In most reported cases, surgical excision (removal) of the mass has been the only treatment. For spindle cell hemangioma, simple excision is reportedly curative; however, new growths develop in adjacent skin and soft tissues in 60% of affected individuals. For individuals with papillary intralymphatic angioendothelioma (PILA), excision of the involved lymph nodes, as well as the mass, has been recommended. Surgical excision is reportedly also the usual treatment for individuals with retiform hemangioendothelioma (although local recurrence with this type is common), epithelioid hemangioendothelioma, and composite hemangioendothelioma (with the exception of 1 case treated with interferon). Most individuals with pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma have been treated with simple excision, but a few individuals have also received post-surgical radiotherapy (RT). With regard to kaposiform hemangioendothelioma, some large lesions cannot be completely removed and may cause fatal complications due to the associated KasabachMerritt syndrome. In these cases, several medical therapies have been used, including systemic corticosteroids; alfa interferon; RT; embolization; and several other therapies, both alone and in various combinations. A study by Scott et al published in 2012 in the American Journal of Clinical Oncology evaluated the effectiveness of RT as either an alternative or adjunct to surgery. The authors stated that the effectiveness of definitive RT in the treatment of hemangioendothelioma in their study implies that radiation may be an acceptable alternative when surgical resection will compromise function or cosmetic result. They concluded that with no local recurrences and minimal risk of toxicity, their long-term data suggest that RT offers a highly effective management option for this disease.",d75db300,Can radiation therapy be used as a primary treatment for hemangioendothelioma?,treatment,0.7865319
"Based on the information provided, inherited thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) primarily affects newborns and children, with most individuals showing symptoms **soon after birth**. This indicates that newborns have the higher chance of presenting with inherited TTP compared with older children, although both groups are at risk.","Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a rare disorder. Most cases of TTP are acquired. Acquired TTP mostly occurs in adults, but it can affect children. The condition occurs more often in women and in Black people than in other groups.

"Patients with osteoporosis‑pseudoglioma syndrome typically have severe early‑onset vision loss. Most affected individuals show impaired vision at birth or in early infancy, which progresses to blindness by young adulthood. The visual impairment is caused by pseudoglioma—a group of retinal abnormalities that mimic a retinal glioma—although other eye conditions have also been reported in some individuals.","Spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia, Strudwick type is an inherited disorder of bone growth that results in short stature (dwarfism), skeletal abnormalities, and problems with vision. This condition affects the bones of the spine (spondylo-) and two regions (epiphyses and metaphyses) near the ends of long bones in the arms and legs. The Strudwick type was named after the first reported patient with the disorder. People with this condition have short stature from birth, with a very short trunk and shortened limbs. Their hands and feet, however, are usually average-sized. Affected individuals may have an abnormally curved lower back (lordosis) or a spine that curves to the side (scoliosis). This abnormal spinal curvature may be severe and can cause problems with breathing. Instability of the spinal bones (vertebrae) in the neck may increase the risk of spinal cord damage. Other skeletal features include flattened vertebrae (platyspondyly), severe protrusion of the breastbone (pectus carinatum), an abnormality of the hip joint that causes the upper leg bones to turn inward (coxa vara), and an inward- and upward-turning foot (clubfoot). Arthritis may develop early in life. People with spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia, Strudwick type have mild changes in their facial features. Some infants are born with an opening in the roof of the mouth (a cleft palate) and their cheekbones may appear flattened.

"Mutations in KRT5 or KRT14 disrupt the normal keratin 5 and keratin 14 proteins so that they cannot assemble into strong, stable intermediate‑filament networks within epidermal cells. Because these networks give the skin its strength and resilience, the defective keratins make the epidermis fragile, less resistant to friction or minor trauma, and prone to blistering.","The four major types of epidermolysis bullosa simplex can result from mutations in either the KRT5 or KRT14 gene. These genes provide instructions for making proteins called keratin 5 and keratin 14. These tough, fibrous proteins work together to provide strength and resiliency to the outer layer of the skin (the epidermis). Mutations in either the KRT5 or KRT14 gene prevent the keratin proteins from assembling into strong networks, causing cells in the epidermis to become fragile and easily damaged. As a result, the skin is less resistant to friction and minor trauma and blisters easily. In rare cases, no KRT5 or KRT14 gene mutations are identified in people with one of the four major types of epidermolysis bullosa simplex. Mutations in another gene, PLEC, have been associated with the rare Ogna type of epidermolysis bullosa simplex.

"Sunlight can be a useful part of treating mild guttate psoriasis.  In the context of guttate psoriasis, the information states that **“sunlight may help some symptoms go away.”**  The ultraviolet (UV) rays in natural sunlight can reduce inflammation and slow the rapid growth of skin cells that characterizes psoriasis, leading to an improvement in the rash.

**Precautions to take**

- **Avoid sunburn** – The same source of UV light that can improve psoriasis can also damage the skin if exposure is too long or too intense.  The guidance specifically says to **“take care to avoid sunburn.”**  
- Use a moderate amount of exposure (e.g., short sessions of direct sun, gradually increasing time) rather than long, unprotected periods.  
- Consider protecting areas of skin that are not affected by psoriasis with sunscreen or clothing, while allowing the lesions themselves brief, controlled exposure.  
- If you have a history of skin cancer, photosensitivity, or severe burns, discuss sunlight or phototherapy options with your doctor before beginning.

In summary, brief, controlled sunlight exposure may lessen guttate‑psoriasis lesions, but it is essential to limit the time in the sun and take steps to prevent sunburn. If you are unsure about the safest way to use sunlight, ask your healthcare provider about medically supervised phototherapy as an alternative.","How might guttate psoriasis be treated? The goal of treatment is to control the symptoms and prevent secondary infections. Mild cases of guttate psoriasis are usually treated at home. The following may be recommended: Cortisone (anti-itch and anti-inflammatory) cream Dandruff shampoos (over-the-counter or prescription) Lotions that contain coal tar Moisturizers Prescription medicines containing vitamin D or vitamin A (retinoids) People with very severe guttate psoriasis may take medicines to suppress the body's immune system. These medicines include corticosteroids, cyclosporine, and methotrexate. Sunlight may help some symptoms go away. Care should be taken to avoid sunburn. Some people may choose to have phototherapy. Phototherapy is a medical procedure in which the skin is carefully exposed to ultraviolet light. Phototherapy may be given alone or after taking a drug that makes the skin more sensitive to light.

"X‑linked severe combined immunodeficiency (X‑linked SCID) is passed down in an **X‑linked recessive** pattern:

* **Mother’s role:** The mother carries one altered copy of the gene on one of her two X chromosomes. She can be an unaffected carrier. Each of her children has a 50 % chance of inheriting that X chromosome.
* **Sons:** A son who receives the mother’s X chromosome with the mutation (and a Y chromosome from the father) will have the disorder, because he has only one X chromosome.
* **Daughters:** A daughter who inherits the mutated X from her mother will usually be a carrier (the normal X from the father can compensate), and she will rarely be affected unless both X chromosomes carry the mutation.
* **Father’s role:** Fathers cannot transmit the X‑linked mutation to their sons because they pass their Y chromosome to sons; they can only pass the X chromosome (and thus the mutation) to daughters.

Thus, X‑linked SCID is transmitted from an affected or carrier mother to her sons, while fathers do not pass the condition to their male offspring.","This condition is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern. The gene associated with this condition is located on the X chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. In males (who have only one X chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In females (who have two X chromosomes), a mutation would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. Because it is unlikely that females will have two altered copies of this gene, males are affected by X-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than females.

"Yes. Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) can progress to a number of serious complications. Because the low‑oxygen, high‑carbon‑dioxide environment impairs gas exchange, people with OHS may develop:

* **Leg edema** (fluid buildup in the lower extremities)  
* **Pulmonary hypertension** (high blood‑pressure in the lungs)  
* **Cor pulmonale** – right‑sided heart failure caused by the strain of pulmonary hypertension  
* **Secondary erythrocytosis** (an increase in red‑blood‑cell production)  

If untreated, these problems can become life‑threatening.

### Steps you can take to help prevent these complications  

1. **Follow your prescribed breathing therapy** – Use the positive‑airway‑pressure (PAP) machine (CPAP or BiPAP) as directed during sleep.  
2. **Pursue weight‑loss goals** – Because OHS occurs in the setting of obesity, losing excess weight reduces the breathing workload. A healthy diet and regular physical activity are the cornerstone of weight loss.  
3. **Stay engaged with your health‑care team** – Attend follow‑up visits, discuss any new symptoms (e.g., swelling, shortness of breath), and keep your ventilator or medication plan up to date.  
4. **Adopt a lifestyle that supports lung health** – Be physically active within your limits, avoid smoking, and manage any co‑existing obstructive sleep apnea.  

By adhering to treatment (PAP, possible ventilator support, medications) and making sustained lifestyle changes—especially weight loss through a balanced diet and regular exercise—you can lower the risk that OHS will lead to these additional health problems.","Obesity hypoventilation (HI-po-ven-tih-LA-shun) syndrome (OHS) is a breathing disorder that affects some obese people. In OHS, poor breathing results in too much carbon dioxide (hypoventilation) and too little oxygen in the blood (hypoxemia). OHS sometimes is called Pickwickian syndrome. Overview To understand OHS, it helps to understand how the lungs work. When you breathe, air passes through your nose and mouth into your windpipe. The air then travels to your lungs' air sacs. These sacs are called alveoli (al-VEE-uhl-eye). Small blood vessels called capillaries (KAP-ih-lare-ees) run through the walls of the air sacs. When air reaches the air sacs, oxygen passes through the air sac walls into the blood in the capillaries. At the same time, carbon dioxide moves from the capillaries into the air sacs. This process is called gas exchange. In people who have OHS, poor breathing prevents proper gas exchange. As a result, the level of carbon dioxide in the blood rises. Also, the level of oxygen in the blood drops. These changes can lead to serious health problems, such as leg edema (e-DE-mah), pulmonary hypertension (PULL-mun-ary HI-per-TEN-shun), cor pulmonale (pul-meh-NAL-e), and secondary erythrocytosis (eh-RITH-ro-si-TOE-sis). If left untreated, OHS can even be fatal. The cause of OHS isn't fully known. Researchers think that several factors may work together to cause the disorder. Many people who have OHS also have obstructive sleep apnea. Obstructive sleep apnea is a common disorder in which the airway collapses or is blocked during sleep. This causes pauses in breathing or shallow breaths while you sleep. Obstructive sleep apnea disrupts your sleep and causes you to feel very tired during the day. (For more information, go to the Health Topics Sleep Apnea article.) Outlook Doctors treat OHS in a number of ways. One way is with positive airway pressure (PAP) machines, which are used during sleep. PAP therapy uses mild air pressure to keep your airways open. Your doctor might recommend CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) or BiPAP (bilevel positive airway pressure). If your doctor prescribes PAP therapy, you'll work with someone from a home equipment provider to select a CPAP or BiPAP machine. The home equipment provider will help you select a machine based on your prescription and the features that meet your needs. Other treatments for OHS include ventilator (VEN-til-a-tor) support and medicines. (A ventilator is a machine that supports breathing.) OHS occurs with obesity, so your doctor will likely recommend weight loss as part of your treatment plan. Successful weight loss often involves setting goals and making lifestyle changes, such as following a healthy diet and being physically active. OHS can lead to other serious health problems, so following your treatment plan is important.

"When a disorder is described as **autosomal recessive**, it means that **both copies of a specific gene in each cell must have mutations for the person to be affected**. The condition is not linked to sex chromosomes (hence “autosomal”) and is inherited in a recessive manner:

* **Parents are typically carriers** – each parent carries one mutated copy of the gene but usually does not show signs or symptoms of the disorder.  
* **Risk to offspring** – when two carriers have a child, there is a 25 % chance the child will inherit two mutated copies (and be affected), a 50 % chance the child will be a carrier like the parents, and a 25 % chance the child will inherit two normal copies.  
* **Carrier effects** – although carriers are generally asymptomatic, in some conditions they may have mild features (e.g., slightly reduced bone mineral density).

"Babies with Bartter syndrome commonly show problems that begin either before birth (the antenatal forms) or in the first months of life (the classical infantile form).

**Before birth (antenatal types I, II, IV)**
* Excess amniotic fluid (polyhydramnios) and often premature delivery  
* May be born with severe loss of salt (sodium‑chloride)  

**In the newborn period**
* Fever, vomiting and/or diarrhea  
* Poor weight gain and failure to thrive  
* Delayed growth and, in some cases, intellectual disability  
* Distinctive facial features – triangular face, prominent forehead, large eyes, protruding ears and a drooping mouth  

**During early infancy (classical Bartter syndrome)**
* Failure to thrive and constipation in the first year  
* Craving for salt, fatigue and generalized muscle weakness  
* Growth and developmental delay  
* Dehydration, increased urine output (polyuria) and loss of excess sodium‑chloride in the urine  
* Excess calcium loss in the urine leading to kidney calcifications (nephrocalcinosis) and weakened bones (osteopenia)  

These signs together constitute the typical symptom picture for babies affected by Bartter syndrome.","What are the signs and symptoms of Bartter syndrome? The signs and symptoms associated with Bartter syndrome can vary depending on the form of Bartter syndrome an affected individual has. The antenatal forms (beginning before birth) can be life-threatening, while the classical form, beginning in early childhood, tends to be less severe. The antenatal forms of Bartter syndrome (types I, II and IV) may first be characterized by abnormally high levels of amniotic fluid surrounding the affected fetus (polyhydramnios); premature delivery; and possibly life-threatening salt (sodium-chloride) loss. Affected newborns may have fever, vomiting, diarrhea, failure to thrive, delayed growth, intellectual disability, and/or distinctive facial features (triangular face, prominent forehead, large eyes, protruding ears, and drooping mouth). Individuals with type IV may also have sensorineural deafness (hearing loss caused by abnormalities in the inner ear). Classical Bartter syndrome typically becomes apparent in infancy and is characterized by failure to thrive and constipation in the first year of life. Symptoms may include salt craving, fatigue, muscle weakness, growth delay and developmental delay. Loss of excess sodium chloride through the urine can lead to dehydration, constipation, and increased urine production (polyuria). Loss of excess calcium through the urine (hypercalciuria) can cause weakening of the bones (osteopenia). When this excess calcium becomes deposited in the kidneys, tissue in the kidneys can become hardened (nephrocalcinosis). Low levels of potassium in the blood (hypokalemia) cause the muscle weakness, cramping, and fatigue in affected individuals.

Secondary adrenal insufficiency occurs when the pituitary gland (a pea-sized gland at the base of the brain) fails to produce enough adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), a hormone that stimulates the adrenal glands to produce the hormone cortisol. The lack of these hormones in the body can be caused by reduction or cessation of corticosteroid medication, the surgical removal of pituitary tumors, or changes in the pituitary gland.

When PLEC is mutated, plectin is missing or abnormal, weakening this attachment. The resulting loss of attachment makes the epidermal cells fragile, so even minor friction or trauma can cause the skin layers to separate and form blisters—characteristic of the rare Ogna type of epidermolysis bullosa simplex.","The four major types of epidermolysis bullosa simplex can result from mutations in either the KRT5 or KRT14 gene.

These tough, fibrous proteins work together to provide strength and resiliency to the outer layer of the skin (the epidermis). Mutations in either the KRT5 or KRT14 gene prevent the keratin proteins from assembling into strong networks, causing cells in the epidermis to become fragile and easily damaged. As a result, the skin is less resistant to friction and minor trauma and blisters easily.

I’m not sure based on the available information.,"Hepatic lipase deficiency is caused by mutations in the LIPC gene. This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called hepatic lipase. This enzyme is produced by liver cells and released into the bloodstream where it helps convert very low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs) and intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDLs) to LDLs. The enzyme also assists in transporting HDLs that carry cholesterol and triglycerides from the blood to the liver, where the HDLs deposit these fats so they can be redistributed to other tissues or removed from the body. LIPC gene mutations prevent the release of hepatic lipase from the liver or decrease the enzyme's activity in the bloodstream. As a result, VLDLs and IDLs are not efficiently converted into LDLs, and HDLs carrying cholesterol and triglycerides remain in the bloodstream. It is unclear what effect this change in lipid levels has on people with hepatic lipase deficiency.",9502c2ec,Can genetic testing reliably identify the LIPC mutations responsible for this condition?,genetic changes,-0.04735183
"**Yes.** According to the provided information, stapes fixation can result from chronic ear infections (specifically otitis media with tympanosclerosis).  

**How it can be prevented (based on the context):**  

- **Prompt diagnosis and treatment of ear infections:** Health‑care providers diagnose middle‑ear infections with an otoscope and often treat them with pain relievers, antibiotics (for severe cases), or other appropriate measures.  
- **Addressing recurrent or severe infections:** Children who experience frequent infections may be recommended to have small tubes placed in the ears (tympanostomy tubes). These tubes relieve pressure and fluid buildup, helping to maintain a healthy middle‑ear environment and reducing the likelihood of chronic inflammation that could lead to stapes fixation.  

By managing ear infections early and preventing them from becoming chronic, the risk of the stapes becoming fixated is reduced.","Progressive deafness with stapes fixation, also known as Thies Reis syndrome, is a form of conductive or mixed hearing loss caused by fixation of the stapes. The stapes is one of the tiny bones in the middle ear. It rests in the entrance to the inner ear, allowing sounds to pass to the inner ear. If it becomes fixated, sound waves cannot pass through to the inner ear, resulting in loss of hearing. This condition may be associated with a number of conditions, including ostosclerosis, Paget's disease and osteogenesis imperfecta, or it may be found in isolation. It may also result from chronic ear infections (otitis media with tympanosclerosis). The progression of hearing loss is generally slow, rarely profound, and usually resolves following treatment.

I'm not sure based on the available information.,"Obesity hypoventilation (HI-po-ven-tih-LA-shun) syndrome (OHS) is a breathing disorder that affects some obese people. In OHS, poor breathing results in too much carbon dioxide (hypoventilation) and too little oxygen in the blood (hypoxemia). OHS sometimes is called Pickwickian syndrome. Overview To understand OHS, it helps to understand how the lungs work. When you breathe, air passes through your nose and mouth into your windpipe. The air then travels to your lungs' air sacs. These sacs are called alveoli (al-VEE-uhl-eye). Small blood vessels called capillaries (KAP-ih-lare-ees) run through the walls of the air sacs. When air reaches the air sacs, oxygen passes through the air sac walls into the blood in the capillaries. At the same time, carbon dioxide moves from the capillaries into the air sacs. This process is called gas exchange. In people who have OHS, poor breathing prevents proper gas exchange. As a result, the level of carbon dioxide in the blood rises. Also, the level of oxygen in the blood drops. These changes can lead to serious health problems, such as leg edema (e-DE-mah), pulmonary hypertension (PULL-mun-ary HI-per-TEN-shun), cor pulmonale (pul-meh-NAL-e), and secondary erythrocytosis (eh-RITH-ro-si-TOE-sis). If left untreated, OHS can even be fatal. The cause of OHS isn't fully known. Researchers think that several factors may work together to cause the disorder. Many people who have OHS also have obstructive sleep apnea. Obstructive sleep apnea is a common disorder in which the airway collapses or is blocked during sleep. This causes pauses in breathing or shallow breaths while you sleep. Obstructive sleep apnea disrupts your sleep and causes you to feel very tired during the day. (For more information, go to the Health Topics Sleep Apnea article.) Outlook Doctors treat OHS in a number of ways. One way is with positive airway pressure (PAP) machines, which are used during sleep. PAP therapy uses mild air pressure to keep your airways open. Your doctor might recommend CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) or BiPAP (bilevel positive airway pressure). If your doctor prescribes PAP therapy, you'll work with someone from a home equipment provider to select a CPAP or BiPAP machine. The home equipment provider will help you select a machine based on your prescription and the features that meet your needs. Other treatments for OHS include ventilator (VEN-til-a-tor) support and medicines. (A ventilator is a machine that supports breathing.) OHS occurs with obesity, so your doctor will likely recommend weight loss as part of your treatment plan. Successful weight loss often involves setting goals and making lifestyle changes, such as following a healthy diet and being physically active. OHS can lead to other serious health problems, so following your treatment plan is important. Your health care team, home equipment provider, and family can help you manage your treatment.",0f4682be,"How is obesity hypoventilation syndrome diagnosed, and what tests are involved?",information,0.047516763

*I’m not sure based on the available information.*","Spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia, Strudwick type is an inherited disorder of bone growth that results in short stature (dwarfism), skeletal abnormalities, and problems with vision. This condition affects the bones of the spine (spondylo-) and two regions (epiphyses and metaphyses) near the ends of long bones in the arms and legs. The Strudwick type was named after the first reported patient with the disorder. People with this condition have short stature from birth, with a very short trunk and shortened limbs. Their hands and feet, however, are usually average-sized. Affected individuals may have an abnormally curved lower back (lordosis) or a spine that curves to the side (scoliosis). This abnormal spinal curvature may be severe and can cause problems with breathing. Instability of the spinal bones (vertebrae) in the neck may increase the risk of spinal cord damage. Other skeletal features include flattened vertebrae (platyspondyly), severe protrusion of the breastbone (pectus carinatum), an abnormality of the hip joint that causes the upper leg bones to turn inward (coxa vara), and an inward- and upward-turning foot (clubfoot). Arthritis may develop early in life. People with spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia, Strudwick type have mild changes in their facial features. Some infants are born with an opening in the roof of the mouth (a cleft palate) and their cheekbones may appear flattened.

"A minor cut stops bleeding when a clot forms to seal the damaged blood vessels. Clot formation depends on platelets and clotting‑factor proteins. In people with bleeding disorders they either lack enough platelets, lack enough clotting factors, or have clotting factors that do not work properly. Because the clotting system is impaired, the normal rapid formation of a stable clot does not occur, so blood continues to ooze from even a small wound. This defect in the clotting process explains why a minor cut can lead to prolonged bleeding in individuals with bleeding disorders.","Normally, if you get hurt, your body forms a blood clot to stop the bleeding. For blood to clot, your body needs cells called platelets and proteins known as clotting factors. If you have a bleeding disorder, you either do not have enough platelets or clotting factors or they don't work the way they should.

"The ADAMTS13 activity assay measures how much functional ADAMTS13 enzyme is present in your blood. In thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) the disease is caused by a lack of ADAMTS13 activity, so a very low or absent result on this test supports the diagnosis of TTP. Because the test directly evaluates the enzyme whose deficiency drives the condition, it helps your doctor confirm whether TTP is the cause of your symptoms and guides the decision to start the specific, often urgent, treatments needed for TTP.","Your doctor will diagnosis thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) based on your medical history, a physical exam, and test results. If TTP is suspected or diagnosed, a hematologist will be involved in your care. A hematologist is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating blood disorders. Medical History Your doctor will ask about factors that may affect TTP. For example, he or she may ask whether you: Have certain diseases or conditions, such as cancer, HIV, lupus, or infections (or whether you're pregnant). Have had previous medical procedures, such as a blood and marrow stem cell transplant. Take certain medicines, such as ticlopidine, clopidogrel, cyclosporine A, or hormone therapy and estrogens, or whether you've had chemotherapy. Have used any products that contain quinine. Quinine is a substance often found in tonic water and nutritional health products. Physical Exam As part of the medical history and physical exam, your doctor will ask about any signs or symptoms you've had. He or she will look for signs such as: Bruising and bleeding under your skin Fever Paleness or jaundice (a yellowish color of the skin or whites of the eyes) A fast heart rate Speech changes or changes in awareness that can range from confusion to passing out Changes in urine Diagnostic Tests Your doctor also may recommend tests to help find out whether you have TTP. Complete Blood Count This test measures the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in your blood. For this test, a sample of blood is drawn from a vein, usually in your arm. If you have TTP, you'll have a lower than normal number of platelets and red blood cells (anemia). Blood Smear For this test, a sample of blood is drawn from a vein, usually in your arm. Some of your blood is put on a glass slide. A microscope is then used to look at your red blood cells. In TTP, the red blood cells are torn and broken. Platelet Count This test counts the number of platelets in a blood smear. People who have TTP have a lower than normal number of platelets in their blood. This test is used with the blood smear to help diagnose TTP. Bilirubin Test When red blood cells die, they release a protein called hemoglobin (HEE-muh-glow-bin) into the bloodstream. The body breaks down hemoglobin into a compound called bilirubin. High levels of bilirubin in the bloodstream cause jaundice. For this blood test, a sample of blood is drawn from a vein, usually in your arm. The level of bilirubin in the sample is checked. If you have TTP, your bilirubin level may be high because your body is breaking down red blood cells faster than normal. Kidney Function Tests and Urine Tests These tests show whether your kidneys are working well. If you have TTP, your urine may contain protein or blood cells. Also, your blood creatinine (kre-AT-ih-neen) level may be high. Creatinine is a blood product that's normally removed by the kidneys. Coombs Test This blood test is used to find out whether TTP is the cause of hemolytic anemia. For this test, a sample of blood is drawn from a vein, usually in your arm. In TTP, hemolytic anemia occurs because red blood cells are broken into pieces as they try to squeeze around blood clots. When TTP is the cause of hemolytic anemia, the Coombs test is negative. The test is positive if antibodies (proteins) are destroying your red blood cells. Lactate Dehydrogenase Test This blood test measures a protein called lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). For this test, a sample of blood is drawn from a vein, usually in your arm. Hemolytic anemia causes red blood cells to break down and release LDH into the blood. LDH also is released from tissues that are injured by blood clots as a result of TTP. ADAMTS13 Assay A lack of activity in the ADAMTS13 enzyme causes TTP. For this test, a sample of blood is drawn from a vein, usually in your arm. The blood is sent to a special lab to test for the enzyme's activity.",53a314dd,"How does an ADAMTS13 activity assay help determine whether I have TTP, and why is it important?",exams and tests,0.52568877

"The ITGB2 gene encodes the β2 subunit of several integrin proteins that are embedded in the membrane of white‑blood cells. These β2‑containing integrins recognize inflammatory signals, bind to ligands on the blood‑vessel lining, and mediate the adhesion of leukocytes to the vessel wall and their subsequent migration across the wall to sites of infection or injury. Thus, ITGB2 is essential for the normal attachment and trans‑endothelial migration of leukocytes, and loss‑of‑function mutations in ITGB2 cause leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 1.","Mutations in the ITGB2 gene cause leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 1. This gene provides instructions for making one part (the 2 subunit) of at least four different proteins known as 2 integrins. Integrins that contain the 2 subunit are found embedded in the membrane that surrounds white blood cells (leukocytes). These integrins help leukocytes gather at sites of infection or injury, where they contribute to the immune response. 2 integrins recognize signs of inflammation and attach (bind) to proteins called ligands on the lining of blood vessels. This binding leads to linkage (adhesion) of the leukocyte to the blood vessel wall. Signaling through the 2 integrins triggers the transport of the attached leukocyte across the blood vessel wall to the site of infection or injury. ITGB2 gene mutations that cause leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 1 lead to the production of a 2 subunit that cannot bind with other subunits to form 2 integrins. Leukocytes that lack these integrins cannot attach to the blood vessel wall or cross the vessel wall to contribute to the immune response. As a result, there is a decreased response to injury and foreign invaders, such as bacteria and fungi, resulting in frequent infections, delayed wound healing, and other signs and symptoms of this condition.",96c8e59a,What role does the ITGB2 gene play in leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 1?,genetic changes,0.90786237
