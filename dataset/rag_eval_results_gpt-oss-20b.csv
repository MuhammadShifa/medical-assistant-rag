"Based on the medical information provided, a doctor will review your medical history for the following factors that can increase the risk of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP):

1. **Existing diseases or conditions**
   - Cancer
   - HIV infection
   - Systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus)
   - Other infections
   - Pregnancy (gestational TTP)

2. **Prior medical procedures**
   - Blood and marrow stem‑cell transplant (or other major transplant procedures)

3. **Medications and exposures**
   - Antiplatelet drugs such as ticlopidine or clopidogrel  
   - Immunosuppressants such as cyclosporine A  
   - Hormone therapies, especially estrogen‑containing medications  
   - Chemotherapy agents  
   - Products containing quinine (e.g., tonic water, some dietary supplements)

4. **Other relevant exposures or histories**
   - Recent infections or autoimmune conditions  
   - Recent surgeries or invasive procedures that may affect blood cells  

These questions help the clinician determine whether you have known risk factors that might predispose you to developing TTP.","Your doctor will diagnosis thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) based on your medical history, a physical exam, and test results. If TTP is suspected or diagnosed, a hematologist will be involved in your care. A hematologist is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating blood disorders. Medical History Your doctor will ask about factors that may affect TTP. For example, he or she may ask whether you: Have certain diseases or conditions, such as cancer, HIV, lupus, or infections (or whether you're pregnant). Have had previous medical procedures, such as a blood and marrow stem cell transplant. Take certain medicines, such as ticlopidine, clopidogrel, cyclosporine A, or hormone therapy and estrogens, or whether you've had chemotherapy. Have used any products that contain quinine. Quinine is a substance often found in tonic water and nutritional health products. Physical Exam As part of the medical history and physical exam, your doctor will ask about any signs or symptoms you've had. He or she will look for signs such as: Bruising and bleeding under your skin Fever Paleness or jaundice (a yellowish color of the skin or whites of the eyes) A fast heart rate Speech changes or changes in awareness that can range from confusion to passing out Changes in urine Diagnostic Tests Your doctor also may recommend tests to help find out whether you have TTP. Complete Blood Count This test measures the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in your blood. For this test, a sample of blood is drawn from a vein, usually in your arm. If you have TTP, you'll have a lower than normal number of platelets and red blood cells (anemia). Blood Smear For this test, a sample of blood is drawn from a vein, usually in your arm. Some of your blood is put on a glass slide. A microscope is then used to look at your red blood cells. In TTP, the red blood cells are torn and broken. Platelet Count This test counts the number of platelets in a blood smear. People who have TTP have a lower than normal number of platelets in their blood. This test is used with the blood smear to help diagnose TTP. Bilirubin Test When red blood cells die, they release a protein called hemoglobin (HEE-muh-glow-bin) into the bloodstream. The body breaks down hemoglobin into a compound called bilirubin. High levels of bilirubin in the bloodstream cause jaundice. For this blood test, a sample of blood is drawn from a vein, usually in your arm. The level of bilirubin in the sample is checked. If you have TTP, your bilirubin level may be high because your body is breaking down red blood cells faster than normal. Kidney Function Tests and Urine Tests These tests show whether your kidneys are working well. If you have TTP, your urine may contain protein or blood cells. Also, your blood creatinine (kre-AT-ih-neen) level may be high. Creatinine is a blood product that's normally removed by the kidneys. Coombs Test This blood test is used to find out whether TTP is the cause of hemolytic anemia. For this test, a sample of blood is drawn from a vein, usually in your arm. In TTP, hemolytic anemia occurs because red blood cells are broken into pieces as they try to squeeze around blood clots. When TTP is the cause of hemolytic anemia, the Coombs test is negative. The test is positive if antibodies (proteins) are destroying your red blood cells. Lactate Dehydrogenase Test This blood test measures a protein called lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). For this test, a sample of blood is drawn from a vein, usually in your arm. Hemolytic anemia causes red blood cells to break down and release LDH into the blood. LDH also is released from tissues that are injured by blood clots as a result of TTP. ADAMTS13 Assay A lack of activity in the ADAMTS13 enzyme causes TTP. For this test, a sample of blood is drawn from a vein, usually in your arm. The blood is sent to a special lab to test for the enzyme's activity.",53a314dd,What medical history questions will my doctor ask to assess my risk for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura?,exams and tests,0.6429455
"Yes.  According to the published case series, definitive radiation therapy (RT) can be used as an alternative to surgery when removal of the hemangioendothelioma would compromise function or cosmetic outcome—particularly for kaposiform hemangioendothelioma and for large lesions that cannot be completely excised.  In those situations RT has shown no local recurrences and minimal toxicity, making it a viable primary treatment option.","How might hemangioendothelioma be treated? Treatment for hemangioendothelioma may depend on the type of hemangioendothelioma present in the affected individual and the risk of recurrence or metastases. In most reported cases, surgical excision (removal) of the mass has been the only treatment. For spindle cell hemangioma, simple excision is reportedly curative; however, new growths develop in adjacent skin and soft tissues in 60% of affected individuals. For individuals with papillary intralymphatic angioendothelioma (PILA), excision of the involved lymph nodes, as well as the mass, has been recommended. Surgical excision is reportedly also the usual treatment for individuals with retiform hemangioendothelioma (although local recurrence with this type is common), epithelioid hemangioendothelioma, and composite hemangioendothelioma (with the exception of 1 case treated with interferon). Most individuals with pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma have been treated with simple excision, but a few individuals have also received post-surgical radiotherapy (RT). With regard to kaposiform hemangioendothelioma, some large lesions cannot be completely removed and may cause fatal complications due to the associated KasabachMerritt syndrome. In these cases, several medical therapies have been used, including systemic corticosteroids; alfa interferon; RT; embolization; and several other therapies, both alone and in various combinations. A study by Scott et al published in 2012 in the American Journal of Clinical Oncology evaluated the effectiveness of RT as either an alternative or adjunct to surgery. The authors stated that the effectiveness of definitive RT in the treatment of hemangioendothelioma in their study implies that radiation may be an acceptable alternative when surgical resection will compromise function or cosmetic result. They concluded that with no local recurrences and minimal risk of toxicity, their long-term data suggest that RT offers a highly effective management option for this disease.",d75db300,Can radiation therapy be used as a primary treatment for hemangioendothelioma?,treatment,0.7891503
"Yes. According to the provided information, inherited thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) mainly affects newborns and children, with most individuals showing symptoms soon after birth.","Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a rare disorder. Most cases of TTP are acquired. Acquired TTP mostly occurs in adults, but it can affect children. The condition occurs more often in women and in Black people than in other groups. Inherited TTP mainly affects newborns and children. Most people who have inherited TTP begin to have symptoms soon after birth. Some, however, don't have symptoms until they're adults. It isn't clear what triggers inherited and acquired TTP, but some factors may play a role. These factors may include: Some diseases and conditions, such as pregnancy, cancer, HIV, lupus, and infections Some medical procedures, such as surgery and blood and marrow stem cell transplant Some medicines, such as chemotherapy, ticlopidine, clopidogrel, cyclosporine A, and hormone therapy and estrogens Quinine, which is a substance often found in tonic water and nutritional health products",87a80996,Do newborns or children have a higher chance of inherited thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura?,susceptibility,0.8571981
"Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) most commonly arises in the mucous‑membrane surfaces of the mouth and throat.  According to the information above, the highest‑risk sites are:

| Site | Specific areas most at risk for SCC |

HNSCC is classified by its location: it can occur in the mouth (oral cavity), the middle part of the throat near the mouth (oropharynx), the space behind the nose (nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses), the upper part of the throat near the nasal cavity (nasopharynx), the voicebox (larynx), or the lower part of the throat near the larynx (hypopharynx). Depending on the location, the cancer can cause abnormal patches or open sores (ulcers) in the mouth and throat, unusual bleeding or pain in the mouth, sinus congestion that does not clear, sore throat, earache, pain when swallowing or difficulty swallowing, a hoarse voice, difficulty breathing, or enlarged lymph nodes. HNSCC can spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body, such as the lymph nodes or lungs. If it spreads, the cancer has a worse prognosis and can be fatal.

This condition affects the bones of the spine (spondylo-) and two regions (epiphyses and metaphyses) near the ends of long bones in the arms and legs. The Strudwick type was named after the first reported patient with the disorder. People with this condition have short stature from birth, with a very short trunk and shortened limbs. Their hands and feet, however, are usually average-sized. Affected individuals may have an abnormally curved lower back (lordosis) or a spine that curves to the side (scoliosis). This abnormal spinal curvature may be severe and can cause problems with breathing. Instability of the spinal bones (vertebrae) in the neck may increase the risk of spinal cord damage. Other skeletal features include flattened vertebrae (platyspondyly), severe protrusion of the breastbone (pectus carinatum), an abnormality of the hip joint that causes the upper leg bones to turn inward (coxa vara), and an inward- and upward-turning foot (clubfoot). Arthritis may develop early in life. People with spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia, Strudwick type have mild changes in their facial features. Some infants are born with an opening in the roof of the mouth (a cleft palate) and their cheekbones may appear flattened.

"Because the disorder is Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD), and the condition itself is linked to lung immaturity and ongoing respiratory support.  BPD occurs mainly in premature infants whose lungs have not yet produced enough surfactant and who often require prolonged oxygen therapy or mechanical ventilation.  The combination of under‑developed airways, chronic lung injury, and the use of invasive devices creates an environment where respiratory infections are more likely to occur and are more frequent in these children.","Autosomal recessive pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 is a disorder of electrolyte metabolism characterized by excess loss of salt in the urine and high concentrations of sodium in sweat, stool, and saliva. The disorder involves multiple organ systems and is especially dangerous in the newborn period.

Treatment involves aggressive salt replacement and control of hyperkalemia. The disorder may become less severe with age. Autosomal recessive pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 (PHA1B) is transmitted in an autosomal recessive manner and is caused by mutations in the genes coding for the subunits of the amiloride-sensitive sodium channel (SCNN1A, SCNN1B and SCNN1G).",dca0c466,Why are respiratory infections more frequent in children affected by this disorder?,information,0.3081149
"Mutations in the **KRT5** or **KRT14** genes alter the normal production of the keratin proteins **keratin 5** and **keratin 14**. These proteins are tough, fibrous components that normally join together to form strong, intermediate‑filament networks in the outer layer of the skin (the epidermis). When the genes are mutated, the keratin 5 or keratin 14 proteins are either made in insufficient amounts or are structurally defective, so they cannot assemble into robust filament networks. As a result, epidermal cells become fragile and easily damaged, making the skin less resistant to friction and minor trauma and predisposing to blister formation.","The four major types of epidermolysis bullosa simplex can result from mutations in either the KRT5 or KRT14 gene. These genes provide instructions for making proteins called keratin 5 and keratin 14. These tough, fibrous proteins work together to provide strength and resiliency to the outer layer of the skin (the epidermis). Mutations in either the KRT5 or KRT14 gene prevent the keratin proteins from assembling into strong networks, causing cells in the epidermis to become fragile and easily damaged. As a result, the skin is less resistant to friction and minor trauma and blisters easily. In rare cases, no KRT5 or KRT14 gene mutations are identified in people with one of the four major types of epidermolysis bullosa simplex. Mutations in another gene, PLEC, have been associated with the rare Ogna type of epidermolysis bullosa simplex.

"**Short answer:**  
Yes—many of the cancers described can spread (metastasize) to the lungs or to other organs.

### How the different cancers can spread

| Cancer type | Typical spread (according to the context) |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Head & neck squamous‑cell carcinoma (HNSCC)** | “HNSCC can spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body, such as the lymph nodes or lungs.” |
| **Small‑cell lung cancer** | “Small‑cell lung cancer grows quickly and often spreads to other tissues (metastasizes), most commonly to the adrenal glands, liver, brain, and bones.” |
| **Non‑small‑cell lung cancer** (including adenocarcinoma) | The context notes it is a cancer of the lung, but like other lung cancers it can spread to other organs (e.g., bones, liver, brain). |
| **Mesothelioma** | The context does not explicitly state its metastatic pattern, but malignant mesothelioma is described as a “rare but serious type of cancer” that is “often found when it is advanced,” which implies potential spread. |

---

### Take‑away
- **Metastasis is common** with many types of cancer, especially when the disease is advanced.
- For **HNSCC**, the lungs and lymph nodes are common sites of spread.
- **Small‑cell lung cancer** often spreads early to the adrenal glands, liver, brain, and bones.
- **Non‑small‑cell lung cancers** (including adenocarcinoma) can also spread to other organs, though the pattern varies by subtype.
- **Mesothelioma** can be aggressive and spread, especially at later stages, though the specific sites are not detailed in the provided context.

"Sunlight can sometimes improve the symptoms of guttate psoriasis, helping the rash to clear or feel less itchy.  
**Precautions to take**

- **Avoid sunburn:** Sunlight may trigger or worsen skin irritation if you burn. Use sunscreen and limit the time you spend in direct sun.  
- **Protect yourself:** Wear protective clothing (long sleeves, hat, sunglasses) and seek shade when possible.  
- **Consider professional phototherapy:** If you’re looking for more controlled light treatment, a healthcare provider can prescribe UV‑B phototherapy under supervision, which is safer and more predictable than unsupervised sun exposure.

These measures help you enjoy the potential benefits of sunlight while minimizing the risk of skin damage.","How might guttate psoriasis be treated? The goal of treatment is to control the symptoms and prevent secondary infections. Mild cases of guttate psoriasis are usually treated at home.

"X‑linked SCID is inherited in an X‑linked recessive pattern.  
- A mother who is a carrier passes the mutated X chromosome to all of her children.  
  * Sons who receive the mutated X (and a normal Y) will develop X‑linked SCID.  
  * Daughters who receive the mutated X become carriers (they usually have no symptoms).  
- A father cannot pass an X‑linked condition to his sons, because he transmits only his Y chromosome to them. He can pass the mutated X only to his daughters, who become carriers.","This condition is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern. The gene associated with this condition is located on the X chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. In males (who have only one X chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In females (who have two X chromosomes), a mutation would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. Because it is unlikely that females will have two altered copies of this gene, males are affected by X-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than females.

"Yes. According to the information provided:

* **Hearing:** Sensorineural deafness (hearing loss caused by inner‑ear abnormalities) has been documented in the antenatal (type IV) form of Bartter syndrome.  
* **Eyes:** The syndrome is associated with distinctive facial features such as *large eyes* and a *prominent forehead*, but no functional visual impairment (e.g., optic atrophy, retinal disease) is listed in the context given.  

So, the main specific sensory issue noted for Bartter syndrome is sensorineural hearing loss, particularly in type IV.","What are the signs and symptoms of Bartter syndrome? The signs and symptoms associated with Bartter syndrome can vary depending on the form of Bartter syndrome an affected individual has. The antenatal forms (beginning before birth) can be life-threatening, while the classical form, beginning in early childhood, tends to be less severe. The antenatal forms of Bartter syndrome (types I, II and IV) may first be characterized by abnormally high levels of amniotic fluid surrounding the affected fetus (polyhydramnios); premature delivery; and possibly life-threatening salt (sodium-chloride) loss. Affected newborns may have fever, vomiting, diarrhea, failure to thrive, delayed growth, intellectual disability, and/or distinctive facial features (triangular face, prominent forehead, large eyes, protruding ears, and drooping mouth). Individuals with type IV may also have sensorineural deafness (hearing loss caused by abnormalities in the inner ear). Classical Bartter syndrome typically becomes apparent in infancy and is characterized by failure to thrive and constipation in the first year of life. Symptoms may include salt craving, fatigue, muscle weakness, growth delay and developmental delay. Loss of excess sodium chloride through the urine can lead to dehydration, constipation, and increased urine production (polyuria). Loss of excess calcium through the urine (hypercalciuria) can cause weakening of the bones (osteopenia). When this excess calcium becomes deposited in the kidneys, tissue in the kidneys can become hardened (nephrocalcinosis). Low levels of potassium in the blood (hypokalemia) cause the muscle weakness, cramping, and fatigue in affected individuals. The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Bartter syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition.

Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) can lead to several serious health complications. According to the provided information, these include:

- **Leg edema**  
- **Pulmonary hypertension**  
- **Cor pulmonale** (right‑side heart failure)  
- **Secondary erythrocytosis** (increased red‑blood‑cell production)  
- Untreated OHS can even be fatal.

---

### How to prevent or reduce these complications

1. **Use positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy**  
   - CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) or BiPAP (bilevel positive airway pressure) machines keep airways open during sleep, improving breathing and oxygen/CO₂ balance.

2. **Weight loss**  
   - OHS occurs with obesity, so losing weight is a key part of treatment.  
   - Aim for a healthy diet and regular physical activity to support sustainable weight loss.

3. **Follow the full treatment plan**  
   - In addition to PAP and weight loss, your doctor may prescribe ventilator support or medications.  
   - Work closely with your health‑care team, a home equipment provider, and your family to ensure consistent use of equipment and adherence to dietary and activity recommendations.

4. **Manage related conditions**  
   - Many people with OHS also have obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Treating OSA can help reduce overall breathing problems and improve daytime alertness.

5. **Regular monitoring**  
   - Keep up with follow‑up appointments so your doctor can check for signs of leg edema, pulmonary hypertension, or heart strain and adjust therapy as needed.

By combining PAP therapy, weight loss, a healthy lifestyle, and close monitoring, you can lower the risk of the serious complications associated with OHS.","Obesity hypoventilation (HI-po-ven-tih-LA-shun) syndrome (OHS) is a breathing disorder that affects some obese people. In OHS, poor breathing results in too much carbon dioxide (hypoventilation) and too little oxygen in the blood (hypoxemia). OHS sometimes is called Pickwickian syndrome. Overview To understand OHS, it helps to understand how the lungs work. When you breathe, air passes through your nose and mouth into your windpipe. The air then travels to your lungs' air sacs. These sacs are called alveoli (al-VEE-uhl-eye). Small blood vessels called capillaries (KAP-ih-lare-ees) run through the walls of the air sacs. When air reaches the air sacs, oxygen passes through the air sac walls into the blood in the capillaries. At the same time, carbon dioxide moves from the capillaries into the air sacs. This process is called gas exchange. In people who have OHS, poor breathing prevents proper gas exchange. As a result, the level of carbon dioxide in the blood rises. Also, the level of oxygen in the blood drops. These changes can lead to serious health problems, such as leg edema (e-DE-mah), pulmonary hypertension (PULL-mun-ary HI-per-TEN-shun), cor pulmonale (pul-meh-NAL-e), and secondary erythrocytosis (eh-RITH-ro-si-TOE-sis). If left untreated, OHS can even be fatal. The cause of OHS isn't fully known. Researchers think that several factors may work together to cause the disorder. Many people who have OHS also have obstructive sleep apnea. Obstructive sleep apnea is a common disorder in which the airway collapses or is blocked during sleep. This causes pauses in breathing or shallow breaths while you sleep. Obstructive sleep apnea disrupts your sleep and causes you to feel very tired during the day. (For more information, go to the Health Topics Sleep Apnea article.) Outlook Doctors treat OHS in a number of ways. One way is with positive airway pressure (PAP) machines, which are used during sleep. PAP therapy uses mild air pressure to keep your airways open. Your doctor might recommend CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) or BiPAP (bilevel positive airway pressure). If your doctor prescribes PAP therapy, you'll work with someone from a home equipment provider to select a CPAP or BiPAP machine. The home equipment provider will help you select a machine based on your prescription and the features that meet your needs. Other treatments for OHS include ventilator (VEN-til-a-tor) support and medicines. (A ventilator is a machine that supports breathing.) OHS occurs with obesity, so your doctor will likely recommend weight loss as part of your treatment plan. Successful weight loss often involves setting goals and making lifestyle changes, such as following a healthy diet and being physically active. OHS can lead to other serious health problems, so following your treatment plan is important. Your health care team, home equipment provider, and family can help you manage your treatment.",0f4682be,"Can obesity hypoventilation syndrome lead to other health complications, and what steps can I take to prevent them?",information,0.78957796

"There is no standard, disease‑specific treatment for megalencephaly itself. Management is individualized and directed at the underlying disorder that is associated with the enlarged brain and at the specific symptoms or disabilities that the person experiences.

**Typical interventions that may be used include:**

| Category | Examples (based on the conditions listed in the context) |
|----------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Symptom‑specific medical care** | Medications to control seizures, hyperactivity or other neurological symptoms; drug therapy tailored to the specific disorder (e.g., PIK3CA‑related overgrowth syndromes). |
| **Therapeutic services** | Physical, speech, and occupational therapy to maximize functional abilities and minimize disability. |
| **Surgical or procedural options** | When indicated by a particular overgrowth or malformation syndrome, surgery or other interventional procedures may be considered. |
| **Rehabilitation** | Programs designed to improve mobility, cognition, or daily living skills. |
| **Genetic counseling** | Helps families understand inheritance risks and informs reproductive decision‑making. |
| **Palliative care** | For symptoms that cannot be fully managed, palliative approaches can support comfort and quality of life. |

"Babies with Bartter syndrome most commonly show a cluster of signs that reflect chronic loss of salt and potassium through the kidneys:

| Symptom | Typical in infant‑onset Bartter |
|---------|---------------------------------|

| **Constipation** | Yes |
| **Dehydration** (dry skin, sunken eyes, decreased urine) | Yes |

| **Developmental delay** (motor milestones) | Often |
| **Hypercalciuria** (high calcium in urine) leading to **nephrocalcinosis** | Often |
| **Osteopenia** (weakened bones) | Possible |

Antenatal (prenatal) forms can also present with polyhydramnios, premature delivery, and life‑threatening salt loss, but the classic infant‑onset presentation listed above is what babies with Bartter syndrome usually exhibit.","What are the signs and symptoms of Bartter syndrome? The signs and symptoms associated with Bartter syndrome can vary depending on the form of Bartter syndrome an affected individual has. The antenatal forms (beginning before birth) can be life-threatening, while the classical form, beginning in early childhood, tends to be less severe. The antenatal forms of Bartter syndrome (types I, II and IV) may first be characterized by abnormally high levels of amniotic fluid surrounding the affected fetus (polyhydramnios); premature delivery; and possibly life-threatening salt (sodium-chloride) loss. Affected newborns may have fever, vomiting, diarrhea, failure to thrive, delayed growth, intellectual disability, and/or distinctive facial features (triangular face, prominent forehead, large eyes, protruding ears, and drooping mouth). Individuals with type IV may also have sensorineural deafness (hearing loss caused by abnormalities in the inner ear). Classical Bartter syndrome typically becomes apparent in infancy and is characterized by failure to thrive and constipation in the first year of life. Symptoms may include salt craving, fatigue, muscle weakness, growth delay and developmental delay. Loss of excess sodium chloride through the urine can lead to dehydration, constipation, and increased urine production (polyuria). Loss of excess calcium through the urine (hypercalciuria) can cause weakening of the bones (osteopenia). When this excess calcium becomes deposited in the kidneys, tissue in the kidneys can become hardened (nephrocalcinosis). Low levels of potassium in the blood (hypokalemia) cause the muscle weakness, cramping, and fatigue in affected individuals.

"Typical symptoms that might suggest obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) include:

- **Excessive daytime sleepiness or fatigue** – OHS often co‑exists with obstructive sleep apnea, which disrupts sleep and leaves you very tired during the day.  
- **Shortness of breath or feeling of breathlessness** – because OHS causes chronic hypoventilation, you may notice a sense of not getting enough air.  
- **Leg swelling (edema)** – chronic high carbon‑dioxide levels and low oxygen can lead to leg edema.  
- **Signs of pulmonary hypertension or cor pulmonale** – such as chest discomfort, rapid heartbeat, or fatigue, which result from the high pressure in the lungs’ arteries.  

If you’re experiencing any of these symptoms, especially in combination with obesity, it’s a good idea to discuss them with your healthcare provider.","Obesity hypoventilation (HI-po-ven-tih-LA-shun) syndrome (OHS) is a breathing disorder that affects some obese people. In OHS, poor breathing results in too much carbon dioxide (hypoventilation) and too little oxygen in the blood (hypoxemia). OHS sometimes is called Pickwickian syndrome. Overview To understand OHS, it helps to understand how the lungs work. When you breathe, air passes through your nose and mouth into your windpipe. The air then travels to your lungs' air sacs. These sacs are called alveoli (al-VEE-uhl-eye). Small blood vessels called capillaries (KAP-ih-lare-ees) run through the walls of the air sacs. When air reaches the air sacs, oxygen passes through the air sac walls into the blood in the capillaries. At the same time, carbon dioxide moves from the capillaries into the air sacs. This process is called gas exchange. In people who have OHS, poor breathing prevents proper gas exchange. As a result, the level of carbon dioxide in the blood rises. Also, the level of oxygen in the blood drops. These changes can lead to serious health problems, such as leg edema (e-DE-mah), pulmonary hypertension (PULL-mun-ary HI-per-TEN-shun), cor pulmonale (pul-meh-NAL-e), and secondary erythrocytosis (eh-RITH-ro-si-TOE-sis). If left untreated, OHS can even be fatal. The cause of OHS isn't fully known. Researchers think that several factors may work together to cause the disorder. Many people who have OHS also have obstructive sleep apnea. Obstructive sleep apnea is a common disorder in which the airway collapses or is blocked during sleep. This causes pauses in breathing or shallow breaths while you sleep. Obstructive sleep apnea disrupts your sleep and causes you to feel very tired during the day. (For more information, go to the Health Topics Sleep Apnea article.) Outlook Doctors treat OHS in a number of ways. One way is with positive airway pressure (PAP) machines, which are used during sleep. PAP therapy uses mild air pressure to keep your airways open. Your doctor might recommend CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) or BiPAP (bilevel positive airway pressure). If your doctor prescribes PAP therapy, you'll work with someone from a home equipment provider to select a CPAP or BiPAP machine. The home equipment provider will help you select a machine based on your prescription and the features that meet your needs. Other treatments for OHS include ventilator (VEN-til-a-tor) support and medicines. (A ventilator is a machine that supports breathing.) OHS occurs with obesity, so your doctor will likely recommend weight loss as part of your treatment plan. Successful weight loss often involves setting goals and making lifestyle changes, such as following a healthy diet and being physically active. OHS can lead to other serious health problems, so following your treatment plan is important. Your health care team, home equipment provider, and family can help you manage your treatment.",0f4682be,What are the typical symptoms that might indicate I have obesity hypoventilation syndrome?,information,0.7939857

"**Secondary adrenal insufficiency** is treated by replacing the hormone that the adrenal glands are not producing (primarily cortisol).  Because the problem is a lack of pituitary‑derived ACTH, the adrenal glands are usually capable of producing aldosterone normally, so mineralocorticoid replacement is usually not needed.

| Treatment option | Typical medications | How the dose is chosen |
|------------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| **Glucocorticoid replacement** | Hydrocortisone (preferred), prednisone, dexamethasone, or a combination of a “short‑acting” and a “long‑acting” agent | • **Physiologic baseline dose** – usually 15–25 mg of hydrocortisone per day in two or three divided doses (≈5–10 mg in the morning, 5–10 mg at noon, 2–5 mg in the late afternoon).  <br>• **Patient‑specific factors** – age, weight, body composition, comorbid illnesses, and overall symptom burden.  <br>• **Laboratory data** – serum cortisol at 8 a.m., ACTH, and sometimes an ACTH stimulation test to confirm adequacy of replacement.  <br>• **Clinical response** – improvement of fatigue, appetite, weight, and absence of hypotension or hyperglycemia.  <br>• **Stress dosing** – the dose is increased (often to 2–3× the usual dose) during illness, surgery, or any stressful event, then tapered back to the baseline dose.  <br>• **Titration schedule** – doses are adjusted in small increments (e.g., 5 mg hydrocortisone) and reassessed over days to weeks to avoid over‑ or under‑replacement. |

**Key points for dose determination**

1. **Goal is physiologic replacement** – the aim is to mimic the normal daily rhythm of cortisol production.  
2. **Start low, go slow** – begin with a conservative dose, monitor for symptom relief and side‑effects, then adjust gradually.  
3. **Use lab values as a guide** – an 8 a.m. cortisol below the normal range suggests under‑replacement; a high cortisol may signal over‑replacement.  
4. **Adjust for stress** – patients should carry an emergency “stress‑dose” kit (e.g., oral or injectable hydrocortisone) and should increase their usual dose during febrile illness, injury, or surgery.  
5. **Re‑evaluate regularly** – dose should be re‑assessed at each follow‑up visit, especially after major life changes (e.g., pregnancy, new medications, changes in weight).

"A mutation in the PLEC gene contributes to the Ogna type of epidermolysis bullosa simplex by affecting the production of plectin, a structural protein that helps anchor the outer layer of skin (the epidermis) to the layers below it. In Ogna‑type EB‑simplex, the mutation either prevents the cell from making functional plectin or produces an abnormal form of the protein. This loss or alteration of plectin weakens the connection between epidermal cells and their underlying matrix, making the skin more fragile and susceptible to blistering after minor trauma. The precise molecular pathway by which PLEC mutations lead to the full spectrum of clinical features in Ogna‑type EB‑simplex is still under investigation.","The four major types of epidermolysis bullosa simplex can result from mutations in either the KRT5 or KRT14 gene. These genes provide instructions for making proteins called keratin 5 and keratin 14. These tough, fibrous proteins work together to provide strength and resiliency to the outer layer of the skin (the epidermis). Mutations in either the KRT5 or KRT14 gene prevent the keratin proteins from assembling into strong networks, causing cells in the epidermis to become fragile and easily damaged. As a result, the skin is less resistant to friction and minor trauma and blisters easily. In rare cases, no KRT5 or KRT14 gene mutations are identified in people with one of the four major types of epidermolysis bullosa simplex. Mutations in another gene, PLEC, have been associated with the rare Ogna type of epidermolysis bullosa simplex.

| Treatment | Typical indications & notes |
|-----------|-----------------------------|
| **Surgical excision** (removal of the tumor mass) | • The most common and often curative approach, especially for spindle cell hemangioma and many other subtypes. <br>• May include removal of involved lymph nodes for papillary intralymphatic angio‑endothelioma (PILA). <br>• Local recurrence can occur in some variants (e.g., retiform, epithelioid). |
| **Radiation therapy (RT)** | • Considered when surgical removal would compromise function or cosmesis. <br>• Demonstrated to be effective with no local recurrences and minimal toxicity in long‑term studies. |
| **Medical therapies** | • **Systemic corticosteroids** – used in large kaposiform hemangioendothelioma lesions, especially when Kasabach‑Merritt syndrome is present. <br>• **α‑interferon** – another option for kaposiform cases. <br>• **Post‑operative radiotherapy** – employed in some pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma cases. |
| **Embolization** | • Employed pre‑operatively (or as an alternative) to reduce intra‑operative bleeding in highly vascular lesions, particularly in kaposiform hemangioendothelioma. |
| **Combination therapies** | • Various combinations of the above (e.g., surgery + RT, corticosteroids + interferon) are used depending on the specific subtype and disease burden. |

These options are chosen based on the hemangioendothelioma subtype, lesion size/location, risk of recurrence or metastasis, and potential complications such as Kasabach‑Merritt syndrome.","How might hemangioendothelioma be treated? Treatment for hemangioendothelioma may depend on the type of hemangioendothelioma present in the affected individual and the risk of recurrence or metastases. In most reported cases, surgical excision (removal) of the mass has been the only treatment. For spindle cell hemangioma, simple excision is reportedly curative; however, new growths develop in adjacent skin and soft tissues in 60% of affected individuals. For individuals with papillary intralymphatic angioendothelioma (PILA), excision of the involved lymph nodes, as well as the mass, has been recommended. Surgical excision is reportedly also the usual treatment for individuals with retiform hemangioendothelioma (although local recurrence with this type is common), epithelioid hemangioendothelioma, and composite hemangioendothelioma (with the exception of 1 case treated with interferon). Most individuals with pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma have been treated with simple excision, but a few individuals have also received post-surgical radiotherapy (RT). With regard to kaposiform hemangioendothelioma, some large lesions cannot be completely removed and may cause fatal complications due to the associated KasabachMerritt syndrome. In these cases, several medical therapies have been used, including systemic corticosteroids; alfa interferon; RT; embolization; and several other therapies, both alone and in various combinations. A study by Scott et al published in 2012 in the American Journal of Clinical Oncology evaluated the effectiveness of RT as either an alternative or adjunct to surgery. The authors stated that the effectiveness of definitive RT in the treatment of hemangioendothelioma in their study implies that radiation may be an acceptable alternative when surgical resection will compromise function or cosmetic result. They concluded that with no local recurrences and minimal risk of toxicity, their long-term data suggest that RT offers a highly effective management option for this disease.",d75db300,What are the main treatment options for hemangioendothelioma?,treatment,0.89952254
I'm not sure based on the available information.,"Hepatic lipase deficiency is caused by mutations in the LIPC gene. This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called hepatic lipase. This enzyme is produced by liver cells and released into the bloodstream where it helps convert very low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs) and intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDLs) to LDLs. The enzyme also assists in transporting HDLs that carry cholesterol and triglycerides from the blood to the liver, where the HDLs deposit these fats so they can be redistributed to other tissues or removed from the body. LIPC gene mutations prevent the release of hepatic lipase from the liver or decrease the enzyme's activity in the bloodstream.

"Yes. Chronic ear infections, specifically otitis media that becomes chronic and leads to tympanosclerosis, are listed as a possible cause of stapes fixation (also called stapedial fixation). In this situation scar tissue forms around the stapes bone in the middle ear, restricting its movement and producing conductive or mixed hearing loss.

**How it can be prevented**

| Step | Practical recommendation |
|------|--------------------------|
| **Early detection and treatment of acute ear infections** | • Use a healthcare provider’s guidance for pain relief and, when appropriate, antibiotics. <br>• Follow up if symptoms persist or worsen. |
| **Prevent recurrence of middle‑ear fluid** | • In children who repeatedly get otitis media, the doctor may recommend placement of ventilation (grommet) tubes in the eardrum. These tubes keep the middle ear aerated, reduce fluid buildup, and lower the risk of chronic infection. |
| **Manage risk factors** | • Keep the ears dry after swimming; use ear plugs if you swim frequently. <br>• Address allergic rhinitis or sinus conditions that can contribute to Eustachian tube dysfunction. |
| **Avoid barotrauma** | • Use proper equalization techniques during airplane flights, scuba diving, or high‑altitude travel to keep the middle ear pressure balanced. |
| **Regular follow‑up** | • Children with a history of chronic otitis media should have routine otoscopic examinations to catch any new fluid or inflammation early. |

By promptly treating ear infections, keeping the middle ear clear of fluid, and managing contributing factors, the likelihood of chronic otitis media progressing to tympanosclerosis and stapes fixation is markedly reduced.","Progressive deafness with stapes fixation, also known as Thies Reis syndrome, is a form of conductive or mixed hearing loss caused by fixation of the stapes. The stapes is one of the tiny bones in the middle ear. It rests in the entrance to the inner ear, allowing sounds to pass to the inner ear. If it becomes fixated, sound waves cannot pass through to the inner ear, resulting in loss of hearing. This condition may be associated with a number of conditions, including ostosclerosis, Paget's disease and osteogenesis imperfecta, or it may be found in isolation. It may also result from chronic ear infections (otitis media with tympanosclerosis). The progression of hearing loss is generally slow, rarely profound, and usually resolves following treatment. Conductive hearing loss can be restored through surgery or hearing aids. Sensorineural hearing loss can be managed with hearing aids or cochlear implants.",83fa08ed,"Can chronic ear infections lead to stapes fixation, and how can this be prevented?",information,0.7043296

I’m not sure based on the available information.,"Obesity hypoventilation (HI-po-ven-tih-LA-shun) syndrome (OHS) is a breathing disorder that affects some obese people. In OHS, poor breathing results in too much carbon dioxide (hypoventilation) and too little oxygen in the blood (hypoxemia). OHS sometimes is called Pickwickian syndrome. Overview To understand OHS, it helps to understand how the lungs work. When you breathe, air passes through your nose and mouth into your windpipe. The air then travels to your lungs' air sacs. These sacs are called alveoli (al-VEE-uhl-eye). Small blood vessels called capillaries (KAP-ih-lare-ees) run through the walls of the air sacs. When air reaches the air sacs, oxygen passes through the air sac walls into the blood in the capillaries. At the same time, carbon dioxide moves from the capillaries into the air sacs. This process is called gas exchange. In people who have OHS, poor breathing prevents proper gas exchange. As a result, the level of carbon dioxide in the blood rises. Also, the level of oxygen in the blood drops. These changes can lead to serious health problems, such as leg edema (e-DE-mah), pulmonary hypertension (PULL-mun-ary HI-per-TEN-shun), cor pulmonale (pul-meh-NAL-e), and secondary erythrocytosis (eh-RITH-ro-si-TOE-sis). If left untreated, OHS can even be fatal. The cause of OHS isn't fully known. Researchers think that several factors may work together to cause the disorder. Many people who have OHS also have obstructive sleep apnea. Obstructive sleep apnea is a common disorder in which the airway collapses or is blocked during sleep. This causes pauses in breathing or shallow breaths while you sleep. Obstructive sleep apnea disrupts your sleep and causes you to feel very tired during the day. (For more information, go to the Health Topics Sleep Apnea article.) Outlook Doctors treat OHS in a number of ways. One way is with positive airway pressure (PAP) machines, which are used during sleep. PAP therapy uses mild air pressure to keep your airways open. Your doctor might recommend CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) or BiPAP (bilevel positive airway pressure). If your doctor prescribes PAP therapy, you'll work with someone from a home equipment provider to select a CPAP or BiPAP machine. The home equipment provider will help you select a machine based on your prescription and the features that meet your needs. Other treatments for OHS include ventilator (VEN-til-a-tor) support and medicines. (A ventilator is a machine that supports breathing.) OHS occurs with obesity, so your doctor will likely recommend weight loss as part of your treatment plan. Successful weight loss often involves setting goals and making lifestyle changes, such as following a healthy diet and being physically active. OHS can lead to other serious health problems, so following your treatment plan is important. Your health care team, home equipment provider, and family can help you manage your treatment.",0f4682be,"How is obesity hypoventilation syndrome diagnosed, and what tests are involved?",information,0.05095675

Squamous cells are found in the outer layer of skin and in the mucous membranes, which are the moist tissues that line body cavities such as the airways and intestines. Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) develops in the mucous membranes of the mouth, nose, and throat. HNSCC is classified by its location: it can occur in the mouth (oral cavity), the middle part of the throat near the mouth (oropharynx), the space behind the nose (nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses), the upper part of the throat near the nasal cavity (nasopharynx), the voicebox (larynx), or the lower part of the throat near the larynx (hypopharynx). Depending on the location, the cancer can cause abnormal patches or open sores (ulcers) in the mouth and throat, unusual bleeding or pain in the mouth, sinus congestion that does not clear, sore throat, earache, pain when swallowing or difficulty swallowing, a hoarse voice, difficulty breathing, or enlarged lymph nodes. HNSCC can spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body, such as the lymph nodes or lungs. If it spreads, the cancer has a worse prognosis and can be fatal.

"**Yes.**  
Frontometaphyseal dysplasia can produce an abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis). When the curvature is significant, it can restrict the expansion of the chest and thereby impair lung function. In addition, the condition can involve constrictions in the passages leading from the windpipe to the lungs (bronchi), which can also cause breathing problems.  

**Treatment options** (based on the information in the provided context) include:  

| Category | Possible interventions |
|----------|------------------------|
| **Monitoring** | Regular assessment of respiratory status, pulmonary function tests, and imaging of the spine and airway. |
| **Respiratory support** | Use of breathing‑aid devices such as CPAP, bilevel ventilation, or mechanical ventilation if needed. |
| **Spinal management** | Bracing to help control or prevent worsening of scoliosis; in severe cases, surgical correction (spinal fusion or other procedures) to improve chest wall mechanics. |
| **Airway management** | Surgical or endoscopic procedures to relieve constrictions in the bronchi if they are present and are causing significant symptoms. |
| **Supportive care** | Respiratory physiotherapy, incentive spirometry, and measures to prevent infections (e.g., vaccinations, prompt treatment of respiratory infections). |

These options are generally guided by the severity of the curvature, the degree of respiratory compromise, and the presence of airway constriction. The specific plan would be tailored by a multidisciplinary team (pediatric orthopedist, pulmonologist, ENT specialist, and others).","Spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia, Strudwick type is an inherited disorder of bone growth that results in short stature (dwarfism), skeletal abnormalities, and problems with vision. This condition affects the bones of the spine (spondylo-) and two regions (epiphyses and metaphyses) near the ends of long bones in the arms and legs. The Strudwick type was named after the first reported patient with the disorder. People with this condition have short stature from birth, with a very short trunk and shortened limbs. Their hands and feet, however, are usually average-sized. Affected individuals may have an abnormally curved lower back (lordosis) or a spine that curves to the side (scoliosis). This abnormal spinal curvature may be severe and can cause problems with breathing. Instability of the spinal bones (vertebrae) in the neck may increase the risk of spinal cord damage. Other skeletal features include flattened vertebrae (platyspondyly), severe protrusion of the breastbone (pectus carinatum), an abnormality of the hip joint that causes the upper leg bones to turn inward (coxa vara), and an inward- and upward-turning foot (clubfoot). Arthritis may develop early in life. People with spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia, Strudwick type have mild changes in their facial features. Some infants are born with an opening in the roof of the mouth (a cleft palate) and their cheekbones may appear flattened.

"Because the normal clotting process is impaired.  
A blood clot stops bleeding by a coordinated series of steps that require both **platelets** and **clotting factors**. In people with a bleeding disorder, they either lack enough of these cells or proteins, or the proteins do not function properly. Without a normal clot‑forming response, a minor cut can continue to ooze blood for a prolonged period rather than forming a stable clot that stops the loss of blood.","Normally, if you get hurt, your body forms a blood clot to stop the bleeding. For blood to clot, your body needs cells called platelets and proteins known as clotting factors. If you have a bleeding disorder, you either do not have enough platelets or clotting factors or they don't work the way they should. Bleeding disorders can be the result of other diseases, such as severe liver disease. They can also be inherited. Hemophilia is an inherited bleeding disorder.

"An ADAMTS13 activity assay measures how much of the ADAMTS13 enzyme is working in your blood. In thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), the body either lacks this enzyme or it is inhibited, so the assay will show markedly reduced or absent activity. A low ADAMTS13 level is the hallmark laboratory finding that supports a diagnosis of TTP and helps distinguish it from other conditions that can also cause low platelets and microangiopathic hemolysis (such as hemolytic‑uremic syndrome or drug‑induced thrombocytopenia).

Because TTP is a medical emergency that requires prompt plasma‑exchange therapy, knowing whether ADAMTS13 activity is deficient lets the clinician confirm the diagnosis quickly and start lifesaving treatment without delay. Thus, the ADAMTS13 assay is a key tool for diagnosing TTP and guiding appropriate therapy.","Your doctor will diagnosis thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) based on your medical history, a physical exam, and test results. If TTP is suspected or diagnosed, a hematologist will be involved in your care. A hematologist is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating blood disorders. Medical History Your doctor will ask about factors that may affect TTP. For example, he or she may ask whether you: Have certain diseases or conditions, such as cancer, HIV, lupus, or infections (or whether you're pregnant). Have had previous medical procedures, such as a blood and marrow stem cell transplant. Take certain medicines, such as ticlopidine, clopidogrel, cyclosporine A, or hormone therapy and estrogens, or whether you've had chemotherapy. Have used any products that contain quinine. Quinine is a substance often found in tonic water and nutritional health products. Physical Exam As part of the medical history and physical exam, your doctor will ask about any signs or symptoms you've had. He or she will look for signs such as: Bruising and bleeding under your skin Fever Paleness or jaundice (a yellowish color of the skin or whites of the eyes) A fast heart rate Speech changes or changes in awareness that can range from confusion to passing out Changes in urine Diagnostic Tests Your doctor also may recommend tests to help find out whether you have TTP. Complete Blood Count This test measures the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in your blood. For this test, a sample of blood is drawn from a vein, usually in your arm. If you have TTP, you'll have a lower than normal number of platelets and red blood cells (anemia). Blood Smear For this test, a sample of blood is drawn from a vein, usually in your arm. Some of your blood is put on a glass slide. A microscope is then used to look at your red blood cells. In TTP, the red blood cells are torn and broken. Platelet Count This test counts the number of platelets in a blood smear. People who have TTP have a lower than normal number of platelets in their blood. This test is used with the blood smear to help diagnose TTP. Bilirubin Test When red blood cells die, they release a protein called hemoglobin (HEE-muh-glow-bin) into the bloodstream. The body breaks down hemoglobin into a compound called bilirubin. High levels of bilirubin in the bloodstream cause jaundice. For this blood test, a sample of blood is drawn from a vein, usually in your arm. The level of bilirubin in the sample is checked. If you have TTP, your bilirubin level may be high because your body is breaking down red blood cells faster than normal. Kidney Function Tests and Urine Tests These tests show whether your kidneys are working well. If you have TTP, your urine may contain protein or blood cells. Also, your blood creatinine (kre-AT-ih-neen) level may be high. Creatinine is a blood product that's normally removed by the kidneys. Coombs Test This blood test is used to find out whether TTP is the cause of hemolytic anemia. For this test, a sample of blood is drawn from a vein, usually in your arm. In TTP, hemolytic anemia occurs because red blood cells are broken into pieces as they try to squeeze around blood clots. When TTP is the cause of hemolytic anemia, the Coombs test is negative. The test is positive if antibodies (proteins) are destroying your red blood cells. Lactate Dehydrogenase Test This blood test measures a protein called lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). For this test, a sample of blood is drawn from a vein, usually in your arm. Hemolytic anemia causes red blood cells to break down and release LDH into the blood. LDH also is released from tissues that are injured by blood clots as a result of TTP. ADAMTS13 Assay A lack of activity in the ADAMTS13 enzyme causes TTP. For this test, a sample of blood is drawn from a vein, usually in your arm.

"The ITGB2 gene encodes the β‑2 integrin subunit, which pairs with α subunits to form β‑2 integrins (such as LFA‑1, Mac‑1, etc.). These integrins are embedded in the membranes of white blood cells and mediate the binding of leukocytes to the lining of blood vessels and their subsequent migration into tissues at sites of infection or injury. In leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 1, mutations in ITGB2 produce a β‑2 subunit that cannot properly pair with α subunits, preventing the formation of functional β‑2 integrins. Consequently, leukocytes cannot adhere to blood vessel walls or transmigrate into tissues, leading to the characteristic immune defects of the disease.","Mutations in the ITGB2 gene cause leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 1. This gene provides instructions for making one part (the 2 subunit) of at least four different proteins known as 2 integrins. Integrins that contain the 2 subunit are found embedded in the membrane that surrounds white blood cells (leukocytes). These integrins help leukocytes gather at sites of infection or injury, where they contribute to the immune response. 2 integrins recognize signs of inflammation and attach (bind) to proteins called ligands on the lining of blood vessels. This binding leads to linkage (adhesion) of the leukocyte to the blood vessel wall. Signaling through the 2 integrins triggers the transport of the attached leukocyte across the blood vessel wall to the site of infection or injury. ITGB2 gene mutations that cause leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 1 lead to the production of a 2 subunit that cannot bind with other subunits to form 2 integrins. Leukocytes that lack these integrins cannot attach to the blood vessel wall or cross the vessel wall to contribute to the immune response. As a result, there is a decreased response to injury and foreign invaders, such as bacteria and fungi, resulting in frequent infections, delayed wound healing, and other signs and symptoms of this condition.",96c8e59a,What role does the ITGB2 gene play in leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 1?,genetic changes,0.90664387

These therapies are considered when surgical excision is impossible, contraindicated, or would compromise function or cosmesis.","How might hemangioendothelioma be treated? Treatment for hemangioendothelioma may depend on the type of hemangioendothelioma present in the affected individual and the risk of recurrence or metastases. In most reported cases, surgical excision (removal) of the mass has been the only treatment. For spindle cell hemangioma, simple excision is reportedly curative; however, new growths develop in adjacent skin and soft tissues in 60% of affected individuals. For individuals with papillary intralymphatic angioendothelioma (PILA), excision of the involved lymph nodes, as well as the mass, has been recommended. Surgical excision is reportedly also the usual treatment for individuals with retiform hemangioendothelioma (although local recurrence with this type is common), epithelioid hemangioendothelioma, and composite hemangioendothelioma (with the exception of 1 case treated with interferon). Most individuals with pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma have been treated with simple excision, but a few individuals have also received post-surgical radiotherapy (RT).

Affected newborns may have fever, vomiting, diarrhea, failure to thrive, delayed growth, intellectual disability, and/or distinctive facial features (triangular face, prominent forehead, large eyes, protruding ears, and drooping mouth). Individuals with type IV may also have sensorineural deafness (hearing loss caused by abnormalities in the inner ear). Classical Bartter syndrome typically becomes apparent in infancy and is characterized by failure to thrive and constipation in the first year of life.

Loss of excess sodium chloride through the urine can lead to dehydration, constipation, and increased urine production (polyuria). Loss of excess calcium through the urine (hypercalciuria) can cause weakening of the bones (osteopenia). When this excess calcium becomes deposited in the kidneys, tissue in the kidneys can become hardened (nephrocalcinosis). Low levels of potassium in the blood (hypokalemia) cause the muscle weakness, cramping, and fatigue in affected individuals. The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Bartter syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms.

Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.",e3e8adf5,Can Bartter syndrome cause kidney complications like nephrocalcinosis or bone problems?,symptoms,0.60871506
